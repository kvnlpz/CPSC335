Intro:
  This project uses HTML and JavaScript to direct an "ant" in a direction based on the color underneath it. When the color changes
  under the ant, the ant will move in the direction based on the color. 
  
Contents:
  In the zip file you should find:
  
  File README.txt
  
  File index.html. Double click to start running
  
  File animator.js. This shows the behavior of the ant. This will have the setup for which direction the ant will go when the color changes. 
    It also shows how the ant will be changing its direction on screen. The point of the triangle is the direction the ant will be moving in.
  
  File styles.css. Placement and style of the font. Setting background color.
  
  File ComplexityOrder.doc. Describing the Big-O algorithm
  
EXTERNAL REQUIREMENTS: None, should work on any pc, laptop or mac.

SETUP AND INSTALLATION: 
 1. Extract the contents of the .zip folder. 
 2. Double click on the index.html file. As long as there is an available we browser, the
      program should open and run automatically when opened. 
 

FEATURES:
  The program will run automatically for 1000 moves.
  No start and stop feature.
  Does not jump to square when clicked on.
  
BUGS/ISSUES: 
  infinite loop if we just change the color using the array and currentState. We used ++currentState instead and it works but can't find out why.
